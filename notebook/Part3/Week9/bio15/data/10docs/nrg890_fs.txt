COMPUTATIONAL 
PREDICTION OF EUKARYOTIC 
PROTEIN-CODING GENES 

Michael Q. Zhang 

The human genome sequence is the book of our life. Buried in this large volume are our genes, 
which are scattered as small DNA fragments throughout the genome and comprise a small 
percentage of the total text. Finding these indistinct ＆needles＊ in a vast genomic ＆haystack＊ can 
be extremely challenging. In response to this challenge, computational prediction approaches 
have proliferated in recent years that predict the location and structure of genes. Here, I discuss 
these approaches and explain why they have become essential for the analyses of newly 

sequenced genomes. 

Biology has entered the genomic era. The celebrated 
draft human genome is already one year old, and a publicly 
available draft of the mouse genome has recently 
been assembled (see links to the Ensembl mouse 
genome server and the University of Santa Cruz 
Genome Bioinformatics site). At the time of writing, 
whole-genome sequences for more than 800 organisms 
(bacteria, archaea and eukaryota, as well as many viruses 
and organelles) are either complete or being determined 
(see link to Entrez genome). Driven by this explosion of 
genome data, gene-finding programs have also proliferated, 
particularly those that are designed for specific 
organisms. However, the accuracy with which genes can 
be predicted is still far from satisfactory: although, at the 
nucleotide level, 80% of genes are accurately predicted, 
at the exon level only 45% are predicted, and at the 
whole-gene level only ~20%. This is why estimates of 
the number of genes in the human genome are still 
imprecise (ranging from 30,000 to 100,000 genes). 

At present, the annotation of most human genes is 
based on cDNA sequence data. Systematic ＆full-length＊ 
cDNA sequencing programs, such as those at the 
Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) in the USA and at 
RIKEN (The Institute of Physical and Chemical 
Research) in Japan, are generating vitally important 
experimental data towards defining complete gene 
sets for the human and mouse genomes. Of the best-

annotated genes in the REFSEQ database (~17,000), nearly 
half are from such large-scale cDNA sequencing projects. 
Given that expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are 
most often generated from highly expressed transcripts, 
ab initio gene-prediction approaches need to combine 
several sources of information, such as from comparisons 
of human and mouse sequences, to discover new 
genes or rare transcripts. It is clear that further improvements 
to gene prediction are much needed. Even if, one 
day, all human genes were determined experimentally, it 
would still be important to understand how the structures 
of genes are organized and defined, and how they 
can be recognized. The ability to predict a gene structure 
is both an intellectual and a practical challenge. 

Because those interested in gene-prediction 
approaches come from both biological and computational 
backgrounds, this review has been written for a 
broad audience. It provides background information 
and a survey of the latest developments in gene-
prediction programs. It also highlights the problems 
that face the gene-prediction field and discusses future 
research goals. I hope to stimulate the best minds in 
both camps, so that new and creative gene-prediction 
methods will be developed. Although the accuracy of 
gene prediction has been steadily improving, the basic 
algorithms that underlie the various approaches have 
changed little since 1997. Although there have been

all gene-prediction papers refer to four types of ＆exon＊, as 
shown in FIG. 2b; however, these are just the coding 
regions of the exons.To avoid the misuse of these terms, 
I refer to subclasses of exons in this article as 5﹊ CDS, 
itexon, 3﹊ CDS and intronless CDS. 
Finding internal coding exons 
To determine exon.intron organization, an attempt can 
be made to detect either the introns or the exons. In early 
studies of pre-mRNA splicing, short splicing signals were 
identified in introns (FIG. 3): the donor site (5﹊ splice site 
or 5﹊ ss), which is characterized by the consensus 
AG|GURAGU; the acceptor site (3﹊ ss), which is characterized 
by the consensus YYYYYYYYYYNCAG|G; and 
the less-conserved branch site, which is characterized by 
CURAY10.These genetic elements direct the assembly of 
the SPLICEOSOME by base pairing with the RNA components 
of the splicing apparatus, which carries out the 
splicing reaction (FIG. 3).Where short introns, which are 
mostly found in lower eukaryotes (such as yeast), occur, 
the intron seems to be recognized molecularly by the 
interaction of the splicing factors, which bind to both 
ends of it. Such intron-based gene-structure prediction 
has also been used in some computer algorithms (for 
example, POMBE in REF. 11).Recently, however, Lim and 
many good reviews on this topic, and useful benchmarks 
in the research (for example, REFS 1.8), a truly 
fair comparison of the prediction programs is impossible 
as their performance depends crucially on the 
specific TRAINING DATA that are used to develop them. 
Gene structure and exon classification 
The main characteristic of a eukaryotic gene is the organization 
of its structure into exons and introns (FIG. 1). 
Generally, all exons can be separated into four classes: 
5﹊ exons, internal exons, 3﹊ exons and intronless exons 
(or, simply, intronless genes) (FIG. 2).They can be further 
subdivided into 12 mutually exclusive subclasses, 
according to their coding content (FIG. 2a), and it has 
been shown that these subclasses have different statistical 
properties9. Because a vertebrate gene typically has 
many exons, internal coding exons (itexons, or internal 
translated exons) compose the main subclass that has 
been the focus of all gene-prediction programs. 
However, the definition of the term ＆exon＊ has become 
confused, either unintentionally (due to lack of knowledge) 
or intentionally (for convenience). This confusion 
has led to the term ＆exon＊ being used interchangeably 
with the term ＆coding sequence＊ (CDS), which fails to 
take into account untranslated regions (UTRs). Almost 
TRAINING DATA SET 
The known examples of an 
object (for example, an exon) 
that are used to train prediction 
algorithms, so that they learn the 
rules for predicting an object. 
They can be positive training 
sets (consisting of true objects, 
such as exons) or negative 
training sets (consisting of false 
objects, such as pseudoexons).

exons in a ＆sea＊ of intronic DNA, where many cryptic 
splice sites exist. This model has since been validated by 
many experiments, and it proposes that an internal exon 
is initially recognized by the presence of a chain of interacting 
splicing factors that span it (FIG. 3).The binding of 
these trans-acting factors to the pre-mRNA is responsible 
for the non-random nucleotide patterns that form 
the molecular basis for all exon-recognition algorithms. 
These sequence features are often divided into two 
types: ＆signals＊, which correspond to short cis-elements 
or boundary sites (such as splice sites and branch 
sites); and ＆content＊, which corresponds to the 
extended functional regions (such as exons and 
introns). To evaluate each feature, one needs to define 
a scoring function of the feature (also called a feature 
variable). The best scoring function is the conditional 
probability P(a|s) that the given sequence s contains 
the feature a. According to the Bayes equation P(a|s) 
= P(s|a)P(a)/P(s) where P(s|a) (that is, the likelihood 
P of s containing a). So, a training sample (sequence 
set) with the known feature a is built, and then the 
occurrence of a particular sequence s is counted. 
Different features can then be integrated into a single 
score for the whole object (an itexon in this case). 
Genes are predicted by finding the gene structure that 
has the highest score, given the sequence.Approaches 
differ in their choice of features, scoring functions and 
integration methods. Once the problem is phrased as 
a statistical-pattern recognition problem, many statistical 
or machine learning tools are available for recognizing 
these patterns. Indeed, almost all of them have 
been applied to the exon (or gene)-recognition problem. 
Here, I review just a few generic or popular 
approaches. 
Most early programs used the simple positional 
weight matrix method (WMM,see BOX 1) to identify 
splice-site signals. In recent programs, the correlation 
among positions in a signal is also explored. The 
weight array method (WAM) or Markov models 
(BOX 1) are used to explore adjacent correlations; decision-
tree or maximal-dependence decomposition 
(MDD) methods are used to explore non-adjacent 
correlations; and artificial neural network (ANN) 
methods are used to explore arbitrary, nonlinear 
dependencies. These more complex models typically 
yield significant, but not marked, improvements over 
the simple WMM. However, major improvements 
have come from designing programs that can combine 
many related sequence features. Such features 
can be combined at different levels. At the splice-site 
level, the simplest way of combining features (such as 
splice-site score with exon-content score on the one 
hand and with intron-content score on the other 
hand) is to use Fisher＊s linear discriminant analysis 
(LDA; BOX 1). In the LDA method, the total score is a 
linear sum of the scores of individual features, and the 
coefficients are determined by minimizing the prediction 
error using a positive and a negative training data 
set. This is equivalent to a perceptron method (for 
example, see REF. 14), which identifies an optimal plane 
surface to separate true positives from true negatives. 
Burge12, in a systematic analysis of short introns, have 
suggested that these standard splice sites might not be 
sufficient for defining introns in the genomes of plants 
and humans. 
In vertebrates, the internal exons are small (~140 
nucleotides on average), whereas introns are typically 
much larger (with some being more than 100 kb in 
length). In 1990, the ＆exon-definition＊ model13 was proposed 
to explain how the splicing machinery recognizes

LDA is implemented in SPL . a splice-site recognition 
module of the HEXON program15. A new splice-
site detection program, GeneSplicer, has also been 
developed recently16 and is reported to perform 
favourably when compared with many other programs 
(such as NetPlantGene, NetGene2, HSPL, 
NNSplice, GENIO and SpliceView; BOX 2). 

To discriminate CDS from intervening sequence, the 
best content measures are the so-called frame-specific 
hexamer frequencies (BOX 1), because they capture 
codon-bias information and codon.codon correlations. 
They also capture splice-site preferences, which are the 
most characteristic exon.intron features17.For long 
open reading frames (ORFs), such as in bacterial or 
intronless genes, frame-specific hexamer frequencies 
alone can detect most of the CDS regions. An alternative 
approach18 is to use an interpolated Markov model 
(IMM), in which the higher-order Markov probabilities 
are estimated from an average of the lower-order ones. 
Because the G+C content of mammalian genomes is 
biased by ISOCHORES (for example, see REF. 19), all content 
and signal measures need to be computed separately for 
different G+C regions. Exon size is another important 
feature variable because, for example, itexons have an 

9

approximately LOG-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION. 

By combining splice-site features with exon.intron 
features (such as CDS measures, exon size and others), 
and by using a nonlinear quadratic discriminant analysis 
(QDA), the itexon-prediction program MZEF20 has 
done better at the single-exon level than has HEXON 
(which is based on a LDA method) or GRAIL2 (which is 
based on an ANN method21). However, to further 
improve exon-prediction accuracy, exon.exon dependencies 
also have to be incorporated, as discussed below. 

Finding poly(A) sites and 3﹊ exons 

The correct identification of the boundaries of a gene is 
essential when searching for several genes in a large 
genomic region. Many gene-prediction programs fail to 

identify these boundaries, which results in predicted 
genes being either truncated or fused together. 
Determining the 3﹊ end of a gene is easier than determining 
its 5﹊ end. This is because most of the mRNA 
and EST sequences in GenBank are truncated at their 
5﹊ ends. The exon-definition model can also be applied 
to 3﹊ exons by replacing the 5﹊ ss with the poly(A) site 
and by using the 3﹊-EXON LENGTH DISTRIBUTION . this is 
because long internal exons are rare in vertebrates, 
whereas 3﹊ exons frequently extend for many kilobases. 
The molecular bridge in this case is the interaction 
between the splicing factor U2AF65 and the carboxyterminal 
domain of the poly(A) polymerase, which recognizes 
the poly(A) signal (FIG. 3). 

By aligning 3﹊ ESTs against genomic sequence, many 
poly(A) sites have been identified. In this way, several 
statistical features (including the well-known poly(A) 
signal AAUAAA and the (G+U)-rich site) have been 
identified in six species (yeast, rice, Arabidopsis,fly, 
mouse and human) and used for poly(A)-site recognition22. 
More reliable 3﹊ ends have been obtained by 
aligning mRNAs with genomic sequences. By using 
such a training set, a QDA-based program called 
POLYADQ was developed23, which can predict both 
AAUAAA- and AUUAAA-dependent poly(A) sites in 
the human genome. 

Because almost all gene-prediction programs focus on 
coding regions, they can only identify the 3﹊ CDS instead 
of the real 3﹊ exon. However, any itexon-recognition 
methods can be modified for this task by replacing the 
donor-site signal with the STOP-codon signal (FIG. 2b), 
together with the correct exon length distribution. 

A true 3﹊-exon-prediction program, JTEF24 (BOX 2), 
was developed recently using a QDA-based method, 
which can predict the major subtype of 3﹊ exons . the 
3﹊ tuexons (translated-then-untranslated 3﹊ exons, 
which are those that contain the true STOP codon, see 
FIG. 2a). Because it integrates several features across the 
3﹊ exon, JTEF has substantially improved the accuracy of

either the poly(A)-site-specific program POLYADQ or 
the more sophisticated mutiple-gene prediction programs 
(such as Genscan and GeneMark). At present, no 
prediction program is available for the minor subtype of 
3﹊ exons . the 3﹊ uexons (untranslated 3﹊ exons). 
Developing the 3﹊-uexon prediction program will make 
an important contribution to the gene-finding field. 
However, this will be difficult to achieve, as some of the 
annotated introns in 3﹊ UTRs might be annotation 
errors, especially in the light of recent results, which

indicate that the presence of a stop codon before the last 
intron often leads to the degradation of a transcript by 
NONSENSE-MEDIATED DECAY (see recent reviews in REFS 25,26). 

Finding promoters and 5﹊ exons 
Identifying the 5﹊ end of a gene is one of the most difficult 
tasks in gene finding. This is mainly due to the 
difficulty of identifying the promoter and the transcriptional 
start site (TSS) sequences. At present, of the 
~17,000 human RefSeq genes that are in GenBank, only 
~3,000 of them are annotated for the TSS. Most of the 


Linear discriminant analysis and quadratic discriminant analysis 

Two classical, statistical pattern-recognition methods that are used to categorize samples into two classes. Once samples 
have been represented as points in space, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) finds an optimal plane surface that best 
separates points that belong to two classes. Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) finds an optimal curved (quadratic) 
surface instead. For example, if there are ten true exons and ten PSEUDOEXONS, and two feature variables . 5﹊ splice-site (ss) 
score and 3﹊-ss score . these samples could be represented by 20 points in a two-dimensional space (the 5﹊-ss score on the 
x axis and the 3﹊-ss score on the y axis). LDA (or QDA) would compute a straight (or curved) line through the space that 
can best separate the two classes of exons (with the minimal classification error). 

Perceptron method 

A machine learning algorithm for pattern recognition or classification. Unlike LDA-based approaches, which calculate 
theoretically the final best-discriminant plane, a perceptron method is based on a simple neural network that begins 
with an arbitrary initial plane and then iteratively moves the plane in a way that tries to reduce the classification error at 
each step. 

Hidden Markov models 

Probability models that were first developed in the speech-recognition field and later applied to protein- and DNA-
sequence pattern recognition. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) represent a system as a set of discrete states and as 
transitions between those states. Each transition has an associated probability. Markov models are ＆hidden＊ when one or 
more of the states cannot be observed directly. HMMs are valuable in bioinformatics because they allow a search or 
alignment algorithm to be built on firm probability bases, and it is straightforward to train the parameters (transition 
probabilities) with known data. 

Hexamer-coding measures 

Some methods interpret sequences as successions of ＆words＊ . so-called because nucleotides are not independent of each 
other, but tend to occur together as if in a word . of length k (k-tuples); 6-tuples are called hexamers. In-frame hexamer 
frequencies in a region of DNA have traditionally been used as a powerful way of discriminating coding regions from 
non-coding regions, as some ＆words＊ are more likely to be present in either type of DNA. A score s for a hexamer w, such as 
CAGCAG, can be defined as s(w) = log(freq(w)). Because the frequency of CAGCAG is relatively high in exons, its score in 
exons will be higher than that of, for example, TAATAA. 

Weight matrix method and weight array method 

Used for scoring a signal motif site. In the weight matrix method (WMM), a score s(x,b) is assigned to each position x for 
each base pair b, such that the total score of a motif site can be calculated as the sum of scores at all positions in the site. In 
the weight array method (WAM), a score s(x,w) is assigned to each position x for each word w of length k (when k = 1, the 
two methods are the same). 

Maximal-dependence decomposition (MDD) donor matrices 

A set of donor splice-site weight matrices that are generated using the WMM, each of which is built for a different class of 
splicing donor sites in such a way that the dependence between nucleotide positions is minimized. 

Decision tree 

A classification scheme, which can be used, for example, to split a sample into two subsamples according to some rule 
(feature variable threshold). Each subsample can be further split, and so on. 

Artificial neural networks 

A collection of mathematical models that emulate some of the observed properties of biological nervous systems and 
draw on the analogies of adaptive biological learning. The key element of the artificial neural network (ANN) model is 
the novel structure of the information processing system. It is composed of many highly interconnected processing 
elements that are analogous to neurons and are tied together with weighted connections that are analogous to synapses. 
Once it is trained on known exon or intron sample sequences, it will be able to predict exons or introns in a query 
sequence automatically.

KOZAK SEQUENCE 
The consensus sequence for 
initiation of translation in 
vertebrates. 

PSEUDOGENE 
A DNA sequence that was 
derived originally from a 
functional protein-coding gene 
that has lost its function, owing 
to the presence of one or more 
inactivating mutations. 

cDNA-derived mRNA sequences in GenBank are truncated 
at the 5﹊ end because of the falling-off of the 
reverse transcriptase during cDNA production. 
However, a recently reported new Database of 
Transcriptional Start Sites (DBTSS) contains the 5﹊ ends 
of ~8,000 human genes27; this resource will be extremely 
useful for promoter studies. 

Promoter activation and transcription initiation is a 
complex process28. After chromatin around the promoter 
has been remodelled into the hyperacetylated 
and relaxed state that is associated with transcriptionally 
active chromatin, the next step in transcription is the 
binding of the pre-initiation complex to the core promoter 
(which lies ~100 bp either side of the TSS). The 
initiation of transcription is controlled mainly by transcription 
factors that bind to the proximal region of the 
promoter (which lies ~1 kb upstream of the TSS) and to 
the first intron region. 

There are many promoter- and TSS-prediction programs. 
In general, their performance is far from satisfactory, 
especially with respect to the control of false-positive 
predictions (see, for example, REFS 29.32). For 
low-resolution (~2-kb) mapping of TSS sequences that 
are related to CpG islands in large genomic regions, 
CpG_Promoter33 can be used. However, for the high-
resolution (~100-bp) mapping of a TSS in a 2-kb region, 
Core_Promoter34 might be a better choice. For general-
purpose genome-wide promoter scans, PromoterInspector35 
is reported to have achieved the true-
positive-to-false-positive ratio of 2.3, compared with the 
then best ratio of 0.6 for the TSSW program36 (BOX 1).A 
new program, Eponine37, performs with similar sensitivity 
and specificity to PromoterInspector, and is able to 
predict the location of the TSS better by exploiting significant 
discriminating features (such as the TATA box 
and nearby CpG islands). Further specificity can be 
achieved for specific co-regulated groups of genes by 
exploring specific correlations among several transcription-
factor-binding sites in a functional module38,39. 

As in the case of 3﹊-exon prediction, almost all gene-
prediction programs can only predict the 5﹊ CDS (FIG. 2b). 
This has been done by modifying the approach to predicting 
itexons, by replacing the 3﹊-ss signals with the 
translational initiation signal ATG, using KOZAK rules (for 
example, see REF. 40), together with the correct exon 
length distribution. 

Recently, a real 5﹊-exon prediction algorithm, FirstEF 
(based on QDA), was published41. It separates the CpGrelated 
5﹊ exons from the non-CpG-related ones, and 
uses first-intron-specific MDD donor matrices. It can 
predict both 5﹊ utexons and 5﹊ uexons. By integrating 
many sequence features, it has also improved on the 
accuracy of promoter and TSS predictions. 

Finding intronless CDSs and pseudogenes 

Predicting intronless CDSs might seem to be easy, but 
this would only be true if most genes were intronless 
and if few PSEUDOGENES existed (as in bacterial genomes 
or the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae). For example, 
many S. cerevisiae genes are defined as ORFs of 
300 bp or more because an average protein is long 

(~1,000 amino acids), and such a long ORF is rare 
unless it has been selected for coding42. Although the 
usual hexamer-coding measures, or even simpler 
(species-independent) periodicity or entropy types of 
coding measure, do well at predicting a large coding 
region, they can still confuse an intronless gene for a 
long, internal-coding exon. Many pseudogenes are 
spliced copies of wild-type genes and, unless they have 
accumulated nonsense mutations, it can be very difficult 
to distinguish pseudogenes from intronless CDSs without 
knowing about the wild-type gene or without ruling 
out that the nonsense mutation-bearing region might 
actually be an intron. To make such a distinction 
requires experience and caution43. As current gene-prediction 
programs are biased towards intron-containing 
genes, many intronless genes might have been missed by 
such programs. Many false-positive exon predictions 
have also been caused by pseudogenes. Developing better 
and more specialized algorithms to recognize them is 
becoming increasingly important. 

Exon assembly and single-transcript prediction 

Just as integrating splice-site signals with coding measures 
at the single-exon level can increase the accuracy 
of predicting individual splice sites, integrating various 
exons into full transcripts can also increase the accuracy 
with which individual exons can be predicted. The nonrandom 
nature of DNA is such that molecular interactions 
and functional selection have together created and 
maintained subtle and complex interdependencies 
among different parts of the structure of a gene (FIG. 3).If 
these interdependencies are not incorporated into a prediction 
model, the model will perform less accurately. 
Because the first and last exons of a gene are the most 
difficult to identify, most current assembly programs 
only focus on coding fragments, such as the 5﹊ CDS, 
defined by ATG.GT; the itexon, defined by AG.GT; the 
3﹊ CDS, defined by AG.STOP; and the intronless CDS, 
defined by ATG.STOP (FIG. 2b). A few programs (such as 
Genscan) add two untranslated states: the ＆5﹊ UTR＊, 
defined by TSS.ATG, and the ＆3﹊ UTR＊, defined by a 
STOP.poly(A) site. However, it should be noted that 
these ＆untranslated＊ fragments are defined on a premRNA 
that might contain introns; the real UTRs are 
defined on a mature (spliced) mRNA (FIG. 2a). 

Given all possible gene fragments and their scores, 
dynamic programming (DP) was originally used by 
many programs to assemble a best (highest score) combination 
of compatible parts into a full pre-mRNA 
transcript (for example, see REFS 44,45). When scores for 
different parts are not probabilities, appropriate 
weighting has to be considered before the scores might 
be combined. In Stormo and Haussler46,a general 
method is provided for optimizing such weights. 

More recently, fully probabilistic state models 
(HMMs; BOX 1) have become preferable because, in 
these models, all scores are probabilities themselves. The 
weighting problem has become a matter of counting 
relative observed state frequencies. In a HMM, a DNA 
sequence is partitioned into disjointed fragments or 
states (because of the duality of the regions and

can be used to find the most probable parse 白* (REF. 47)

The advantage of HMMs is that more states (such as 
intergenic regions, promoters, UTRs, poly(A) and 
frame- or strand-dependent exons and introns) can be 
added, as well as flexible transitions between the states, 
to allow partial transcripts, intronless genes or even 
multiple genes to be incorporated into a model. 
Multiple transcript predictions (which might correspond 
to alternatively spliced transcripts) can also be 
obtained by using sub-optimal parses. Because many 
functional features that determine alternative splicing 
have not been incorporated into existing programs, suboptimal 
parses (or assignments) are unlikely to represent 
alternative splicing events. Rather, they can serve as

sensors for splice signals, as well as for coding content. 
Like HMMgene and Genie, Genscan is also based on a 
GHMM2. It also allows exon-specific length distribution 
to be predicted (that is, the model generates blocks of 
base pairs . a whole exon and exons predicted to be of 
average length receive high probability scores). By contrast, 
the intrinsic length distribution for a standard 
HMM is geometric, which results in the exon score 
decaying exponentially with exon length.But, the splicesite 
sensors in Genscan are more advanced than those 
used in the other programs. Fgenesh50, another GHMMbased 
algorithm, uses LDA (BOX 1) as the exon sensor. 
The coding-content sensors all use a fifth-order Markov 
chain (in this approach, the probability score for any base 
pair depends on the previous five base pairs; BOX 1). 
These GHMM programs also model promoters, poly(A) 
signals and the 5﹊ UTRs or 3﹊ UTRs (including possible 
introns) in a relatively simple way (FIG. 4). 
Recently, another gene-prediction program,GRPL51, 
has been developed. It is based on reference point logistic 
(RPL) regression, which is a generalization of logistic 
regression52 that can be used in complex classification 
problems to model the conditional probability that an 
object belongs to a specified class given its observed features. 
In tests of this program, GRPL matches the performance 
of Genscan at the nucleotide level (with 
respect to the correct prediction of exons and introns), 
but does slightly worse than Genscan at the exon level.A 
more recent test of many programs (such as Fgenes, 
GeneMark, Genie, Genscan, HMMgene,Morgan and 
MZEF; BOX 2) on 195 newly sequenced DNAs showed 
that the accuracy of gene prediction (the average of sensitivity 
plus specificity) is ~70.90% at the nucleotide 
level and ~40.70% at the exon level6. In practice, combining 
the predictions of several programs can yield 
even greater accuracy53. 
Multiple genes, partial genes and both strands 
It is easy to add more states or transitions between states 
to HMM-based models so that multiple genes, partial 
genes and genes on both strands can be predicted 
together. These features are essential when annotating 
genomes or large chunks of sequence data, such as large 
contigs, in an automated fashion. The technique of predicting 
multiple genes on both strands was initially 
implemented in Genscan2, and was later adopted in 
other HMM-based algorithms, such as GeneMark54 and 
Fgenesh50. The advantage of modelling both strands 
simultaneously is that it avoids the prediction of genes 
that overlap on the two strands as being two separate 
genes, which are presumed to be rare in mammalian 
genomes.More importantly, it makes the prediction of 
＆shadow exons＊ (exons that are predicted to be in the correct 
region but on the wrong DNA strand) much less 
likely. This can arise because coding-biased sequence 
composition can look distinct from intron or intergenic 
sequence to the predictor . the extent to which this 
effect occurs depends on the organism (see, for example, 
REF. 55).Most gene-prediction algorithms can achieve 
~80% sensitivity and specificity at the exon level when 
tested on single-gene data sets56, but these statistics drop 
a stability indicator: if many sub-optimal parses are very 
close (in terms of their probabilities) to the optimal one, 
the optimal prediction might not be very reliable. 
Because HMMs are fully probabilistic, a score (conditional 
probability) can be obtained for any part of a 
gene. For example, the likelihood of finding an exon in a 
particular interval might be calculated by a ＆forward＊ 
and a ＆backward＊ algorithm47. Because of the interdependency 
of exons, the quality (probability score) of 
an exon also depends on other exons or even on the 
entire sequence.As a result, HMM-based exon-assembly 
methods explore exon.exon correlations and so predict 
exons more accurately than when predictions are based 
on single, isolated exons. 
HMMgene48 is based on HMM and can be optimized 
to predict exons to a high degree of accuracy. The Genie 
program was the first to introduce a generalized HMM49 
(GHMM;BOX 1) and used neural networks as individual

Combining similarity scores 
The use of database search-and-alignment programs, 
such as BLASTX60 and Sim4 (REF. 61), in gene finding has 
been popular because matching a sequence to a known 
protein or cDNA/EST can greatly improve the accuracy 
of gene prediction. Traditionally, ab initio gene prediction 
and similarity searches are run independently, and 
a curator then combines the results manually for gene 
annotation.Many people have tried to integrate these 
methods automatically62.67. 
The ＆splice alignment＊ program . Procrustes62. 
is based on the observation that the detection of exon 
boundaries in a gene can be improved if a close protein 
homologue for that gene exists. Similarly, the 
Ensembl automatic gene annotation engine . 
GeneWise66 . combines a gene-prediction HMM 
with the protein-profile HMM (Pfam) to achieve 
simultaneous gene prediction and alignment. 
Although these methods can be highly accurate, they 
predict exactly one gene per genomic sequence, 
require close homologues to identify complete 
genes68 and are computationally intensive, requiring a 
prescan with, for example, BLASTX to first identify 
candidate regions. To provide a first layer of annotation 
on the human draft, a new algorithm 
GenomeScan was developed recently69, which combines 
exon or intron and splice-signal models with 
similarity to known protein sequences in an integrated 
model. Initial comparisons of GenomeScan 
with Procrustes and GeneWise seemed to favour 
GenomeScan69, because Procrustes and GeneWise 
both predict partial genes, which results in the terminal 
exons being frequently truncated.However, if the 
prediction of internal exons (or splice sites) is considered, 
the performance of Procrustes and GeneWise is 
comparable with that of GenomeScan. Because the 
quality of an EST-derived sequence is generally very 
poor, it must be very carefully combined with any 
automatic gene-prediction algorithms70. In general, 
similarity searches can boost the accuracy of gene 
prediction by a few per cent. For example, GRPL+ is 
the similarity-enhanced version of GRPL51, and has 
shown a 5% increase in prediction accuracy over 
GRPL. 
Comparative genomics methods 
The value of comparative genomics is illustrated by the 
sequencing of the mouse genome for the purpose 
of annotating the human genome. The availability of 
closely related genomes makes it possible to carry out 
genome-wise comparisons and analyses of synteny. 
When two genomes have only recently diverged, the 
order of many genes, gene numbers, gene positions and 
even gene structures (exon.intron organization, splice 
site usage, and so on) remain highly conserved.New 
genes can also be identified from direct genome comparisons. 
By comparing the genomes of several closely 
related species, conserved regulatory regions can also be 
easily identified71. For these reasons, making use of comparative 
genomic data will be a key challenge for the 
gene-prediction field. 
to ~60% sensitivity and specificitywhen these programs 
are run on large-scale genomic DNA data sets57. 
By integrating features across several genes, a feature 
(such as an exon) in one gene becomes dependent on the 
features of other genes.And that is why, when a few starting 
or ending bases of the input sequence are deleted, it 
can change the overall prediction of gene structure. 
There is very little biological evidence for the existence of 
correlations among exons in different genes, except for 
genes at some tightly linked loci, such as the locus control 
region of the 乒-globin locus or where a pair of genes 
is controlled by a common promoter.A probability score 
only makes sense when: first, the underlying model is 
correct, and second, the training samples are not biased. 
As our knowledge about the dependencies between 
genes is very limited,multiple-gene models are unlikely 
to be accurate.As most algorithms cannot even predict 
the first and last exons, the splitting and fusing of genes 
occurs quite often, even with the best programs, when 
they are run on large genomic data sets.An accurate prediction 
of multiple genes will only be possible once we 
have a better understanding of the long-range features of 
chromosomes. These long-range features include insulator 
and boundary elements, and matrix- and 
scaffold-attachment regions58,which all allow a chromosome 
to be broken up into its transcriptionally independent 
domains59. 
BLASTX

(BLAST) is a computer program 
for comparing DNA and protein 
sequences. The BLASTX version 
compares a nucleotide query 
sequence that is translated in all 
reading frames with a protein 
sequence database.

. To predict insulators and boundary elements, and matrix-attachment and scaffold-

. To predict replication origins and recombination hot spots. 
To accommodate large genomic sequences, the traditional 
visualization tools, such as the simple dotplot, 
have been extended recently to more sophisticated 
programs, such as VISTA/AVID72 and PipMaker73, 
which both display the alignment of two or more 
genomes in the form of simple percentage-identify 
plots (for example, regions with 70% identity and 
above are shown). ROSETTA74 is the first automated 
program that annotates human genes by using syntenic 
mouse genomic DNA. WABA (wobble aware 
bulk aligner75) has taken advantage of the third base 
wobble in coding exons to improve alignment, and 
has been successfully applied to aligning the genomes 
of two closely related worms, Caenorhabditis briggsae 
and Caenorhabditis elegans. 

Computational tools for comparative genomics 
are being developed by several groups, and recently 
developed programs include CEM76, TWINSCAN57, 
SGP-1 (REF. 77) and SLAM (M. Alexandersson et al., 
unpublished data) (BOX 2). By using comparisons 
between human and mouse, these groups have shown 
that gene-prediction accuracy can be further 
improved by using two closely related genomes. 
SLAM uses a generalized pair HMM (GPHMM or 
dual-HMM, REF. 78), which can simultaneously predict 
a pair of ＆orthologous＊ base pairs according to a 
dual-HMM model (FIG. 5) in a syntenic region. This 
places the annotation and alignment problem on an 
equal footing. The mathematical beauty of the dual-
HMM is quite appealing, but in its practical implementation, 
SLAM suffers from many restrictions (but 
perhaps also benefits by being faster to compute). For 
example, it is assumed that the same number of 
exons exist in each organism and in the same order in 
a region of conserved synteny, and certain key 
approximations of the genome-wide alignment 
(which are derived from a pre-processing step to 
reduce the computational complexity of the exact 
GPHMM) are used. As about one-half of the conserved 
regions between human and mouse are not in 

coding regions (M. Zhang, unpublished data), they 
have been the main source of false-positives in most 
comparative-genomics approaches. To reduce such 
errors, SLAM has introduced the conserved non-
coding sequence (CNS) state. Although the CNS state 
allows SLAM to detect some homologous regulatory 
regions, the lack of a precise definition of CNS and a 
known CNS training set makes it the weakest point of 
this model. These programs and the programs that 
are now being developed, such as Doublescan (BOX 2), 
will have a great impact on finding new genes in vertebrate 
genomes, and, more importantly, will provide 
a testable list of genes for high-throughput experimental 
validation and refinement. 

Future challenges 

Gene-prediction algorithms have been steadily improving 
in the past decade, but there is still a long way to go. 
This is reflected by the fact that we still do not know 
how many genes are in the human genome79, and fluctuations 
in the estimates of this number are now as big 
as the mean. In BOX 3, I list some of the key problems 
that remain to be solved in this field. 

Bioinformatics is driven by genomic data, and the 
lack of high-throughput experimental approaches to 
identify genes and their functions has become the main 
bottleneck of this field80. However, computational biologists 
should not be deterred by not yet having experimental 
confirmation of their gene predictions, because 
many transcripts are hard to detect owing to their low 
abundance. We should work closely with our bench-
partners, and together, many ＆false-positives＊ (~30.50%) 
might be turned eventually into real positives (for 
example, see REF. 81). Although I have concentrated here 
on the computational side of this field, experimental 
approaches are equally, if not more, important. More 
functional-genomics methods for finding genes . such 
as using genomic microarrays to create transcription 
maps82.84, sequencing full-length cDNAs and improving 
SAGE protocols (for example, see REF. 85) . are desperately 
needed. Furthermore, gene finding would not be 
complete without also identifying alternative transcripts 
and regulatory cis-elements. In this regard, functionalgenomics 
approaches, such as ChIP (chromatin 
immunoprecipitation)-chip analyses (see the recent 
review by Horak and Snyder86) and large-scale analyses 
of alternative splicing (see, for example, REFS 87,88) have 
become the methods of choice. New algorithms will be 
needed to analyse such new data computationally. 
Together with the availability of the genomes of several 
species for comparative analyses, the gene-finding field 
is at its most exciting time. Despite large-scale genomic 
efforts, traditional single-gene dissections are still 
needed for understanding the details of gene-expression 
mechanisms. Only with sufficient mechanistic data can 
gene prediction be transformed from being statistical to 
being biological in nature79. Everyone in the field is 
working towards the ultimate dynamic model that can 
identify the consecutive exons of a gene, from its 5﹊- to 
its 3﹊-ends, as if they were being co-transcriptionally recognized 
and spliced89,90.

. With the recent explosion in the availability of genome data, gene-Links 
finding programs have proliferated. However, the accuracy with which Ensembl mouse genome server 
genes can be predicted is still far from satisfactory. This review prohttp://
www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus 
vides background information and surveys the latest developments in Entrez genome 
gene-prediction programs. It also highlights the problems that face the http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/Genome/org.html 
gene-prediction field and discusses future research goals. Mammalian Gene Collection 
. The main characteristic of a eukaryotic gene is its organization into http://mgc.nci.nih.gov/Info/ProjectSummary 
exons and introns. The ＆exon-definition＊ model explains how the splic-RIKEN 
ing machinery recognizes exons in a sea of intronic DNA. It indicates http://www.gsc.riken.go.jp/e/FANTOM 
that an internal exon is initially recognized by a chain of interacting University of Santa Cruz Genome Bioinformatics site 
splicing factors that span it. The binding of these factors to pre-mRNA http://genome.ucsc.edu 
is responsible for the non-random nucleotide patterns that form the 
molecular basis of all exon-recognition algorithms. 
. Correctly identifying the boundaries of a gene is essential when searching 
for several genes in a large genomic region. It is relatively easy to 
find internal exons, but many gene-prediction programs fail to identify 
gene boundaries. Determining the 3﹊ end of a gene is easier than determining 
its 5﹊ end, mainly because of the difficulty of identifying the 
promoter and transcriptional start-site sequences, and because the 5﹊ 
ends of cDNA sequences are often truncated. 
. As current gene-prediction programs are biased towards intron-containing 
genes, many intronless genes might have been missed by such 
programs. Many false-positive exon predictions have also been caused 
by pseudogenes. Developing better and more specialized algorithms to 
recognize them is becoming increasingly important. 
. Hidden Markov model (HMM)-based programs can be used to predict 
multiple genes, partial genes and genes on both strands, all at the 
same time. These features are essential when annotating genomes or 
large chunks of sequence data, such as large contigs, in an automated 
fashion. 
. By comparing the genomes of several closely related species, conserved 
regulatory regions can be identified easily. For these reasons, making 
use of comparative genomic data is an important future challenge for 
the gene-prediction field. 
. More functional genomics methods for finding genes are desperately 
needed to improve gene prediction. Only with sufficient mechanistic 
data can gene prediction be transformed from being statistical to being 
biological in nature. The field is working towards the ultimate 
dynamic model that can identify the consecutive exons of a gene, from 
its 5﹊ to its 3﹊ ends, as if they were being co-transcriptionally recognized 
and spliced.
